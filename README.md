truffle migrate --reset ==> data in blockchain is immutable, when we change smart contract code, we push a new copy of smart contract to the blockchain.
Migrations should be run once. -> we use _reset_ flag for this

- truffle console -> open the truffle console

Testing is important;
Reduce gas wastage
Once deployed we cannot change - its immutable
Wastage of ether if person uses a buggy function

- truffle test -> test smart contracts
